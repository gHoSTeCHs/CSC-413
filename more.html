				<h2>All About Periods</h2>
				<p>
					A period is a release of blood from a girl's uterus, out through her
					vagina. It is a sign that she is getting close to the end of puberty.
					There is a lot to learn about periods. Here are some common questions
					that teens have.
				</p>
				<h2>When Do Most Girls Get Their Period?</h2>
				<p>
					Most girls get their first period when they're around 12. But getting
					it any time between age 10 and 15 is OK. Every girl's body has its own
					schedule. <br />
					There isn't one right age for a girl to get her period. Most of the
					time, a girl gets her period about 2 years after her breasts start to
					develop. Another sign is vaginal discharge fluid (sort of like mucus)
					that a girl might see or feel on her underwear. <br />
					This discharge usually begins about 6 months to a year before a girl
					gets her first period.
				</p>
				<h2>What Causes a Period?</h2>
				<p>
					A period happens because of changes in hormones in the body. Hormones
					are chemical messengers. The ovaries release the female hormones
					estrogen and progesterone . <br />
					These hormones cause the lining of the uterus (or womb) to build up.
					The built-up lining is ready for a fertilized egg to attach to and
					start developing. If there is no fertilized egg, the lining breaks
					down and bleeds. Then the same process happens all over again. <br />
					It usually takes about a month for the lining to build up, then break
					down. That is why most girls and women get their periods around once a
					month.
				</p>
				<h2>How Does Ovulation Relate to Periods?</h2>
				<p>
					Ovulation (pronounced: ov-yoo-LAY-shun) is the release of an egg from
					the ovaries. The same hormones that cause the uterus lining to build
					up also cause an egg to leave one of the ovaries. The egg travels
					through a thin tube called a fallopian tube to the uterus. If the egg
					is fertilized by a sperm cell, it attaches to the wall of the uterus,
					where over time it develops into a baby. If the egg is not fertilized,
					the uterus lining breaks down and bleeds, causing a period.
				</p>
				<h2>Do Periods Happen Regularly When Menstruation Starts?</h2>
				<p>
					For the first few years after a girl starts her period, it may not
					come regularly. This is normal at first. By about 2–3 years after her
					first period, a girl's periods should be coming around once every 4–5
					weeks.
				</p>
				<h2>Can a Girl Get Pregnant as Soon as Her Period Starts?</h2>
				<p>
					Yes, a girl can get pregnant as soon as her period starts. A girl can
					even get pregnant right before her very first period. This is because
					a girl's hormones might already be active. The hormones may have led
					to ovulation and the building of the uterine wall. If a girl has sex,
					she can get pregnant, even though she has never had a period.
				</p>
				<h2>How Long Do Periods Last?</h2>
				<p>
					Periods usually last about 5 days. But a period can be shorter or last
					longer.
				</p>
				<h2>How Often Does a Period Happen?</h2>
				<p>
					Periods usually happen about once every 4–5 weeks. But some girls get
					their periods a little less or more often.
				</p>
				<h2>Should I Use a Pad, Tampon, or Menstrual Cup?</h2>
				<p>
					You have many choices about how to deal with period blood. You may
					need to experiment a bit to find which works best for you. Some girls
					use only one method and others switch between different methods.
				</p>
				<h2>How Much Blood Comes Out?</h2>
				<p>
					It may look like a lot of blood, but a girl usually only loses a few
					tablespoons of blood during the whole period. Most girls need to
					change their pad, tampon, or menstrual cup about 3‒6 times a day.
				</p>
				<h2>Will I Have Periods for the Rest of My Life?</h2>
				<p>
					When women reach menopause (around age 45‒55), their periods will
					permanently stop. Women also won't have a period while they are
					pregnant.
